# MoveToEarn

MoveToEarn is a simple Rust-based game where the player character navigates through a grid-based maze to reach a target position while managing their energy levels.

## How to Play

The game starts with the player character (`P`) positioned at the center of a grid. A target position (`T`) is randomly generated within the grid. The player must navigate the character to the target position while conserving energy.

### Commands

- **move**: Move the player character in a specified direction.
- **fill**: Fill the energy of the player character using coins.

### Directions

When prompted to move, you can choose one of the following directions:

- N: North
- NE: Northeast
- E: East
- SE: Southeast
- S: South
- SW: Southwest
- W: West
- NW: Northwest
- NNW: North-northwest

### Objective

Navigate the player character to the target position (`T`) by moving in different directions while managing energy levels.
